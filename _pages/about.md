I am currently a **Senior Technical Lead for Protocols, SDK, and Compliance** at **[MailSPEC](https://www.mailspec.com)**, where I focus on refining and writing protocols, ensuring compliance, and developing SDKs. MailSPEC empowers regulated industries with secure and efficient solutions that help organizations connect and collaborate more effectively.

I successfully **defended my [PhD](https://theses.fr/2024GRALM021) in Computer Science** at **Université Grenoble Alpes** in May 2024, where I have been working under the supervision of [Yliès Falcone](https://www.ylies.fr) in the [CORSE](https://team.inria.fr/corse/) team at [Inria](http://inria.fr) since October 2019. My research falls under **software engineering and formal methods**, specializing in **program instrumentation** and [**runtime verification**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification) of **concurrent and distributed programs**. My efforts have led to numerous peer-reviewed papers and the development of advanced tools in this field. As part of my doctoral work, I had the opportunity to visit the [Formal Computer Science Laboratory](https://liflab.ca) at **Université du Québec à Chicoutimi** ([UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca)) in 2021 and 2022, where I collaborated with [Sylvain Hallé](https://leduotang.ca/sylvain/).

Before shifting into research, I built a **10-year track record** in **software development and project management** across a range of sectors, including public services, healthcare, education, and commerce. Throughout my career, I have earned multiple recognitions, such as the **Microsoft Most Valued Professional (MVP)** award for three consecutive years (2014–2016) and the **AUB Computer Science Graduate Student of the Year** <a href="{{ page.pdf1 | prepend: 'assets/pdf/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >award</a>. I have also **authored** the book [_Microsoft Azure Storage Essentials_](https://www.packtpub.com/product/microsoft-azure-storage-essentials/9781784396237), published by Packt in 2015.
