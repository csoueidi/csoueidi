 I am currently a Ph.D. Researcher at [Inria](http://inria.fr), where I have been working since October 2020 on my thesis titled: A Framework for Sound and Expressive Runtime Verification of Multithreaded Applications. My research falls under formal methods and software engineering, specifically `runtime verification` of concurrent and distributed programs. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at the American University of Beirut (AUB) as a Senior Software Engineer and Analyst for nearly seven years. During this time, I developed various `lighthouse projects`, including a student payments portal, an electronic voting system, and an online retail system. I also led a team of computer science and engineering students working on projects for the university.

In the past, I held positions as a Software Development Team Lead at HealthInvest and a Software Engineer at Partners Managerial Systems. My education includes a Master's degree in Computer Science from AUB and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, which I will complete in October 2023.

Throughout my career, I have earned several recognitions, such as the [Microsoft Most Valued Professional MVP award](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000832) for three consecutive years (2014-2016) and the AUB Computer Science Graduate `Student of the Year Award` in 2019. I have also authored the book [Microsoft Azure Storage Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/product/microsoft-azure-storage-essentials/9781784396237), published by Packt in 2015.

As a dedicated computer scientist and software engineer, my commitment to keep learning and growing has been the driving force behind my contributions to the academic and professional communities. I strive to make a positive impact in my field and collaborate with others to achieve our shared goals.
