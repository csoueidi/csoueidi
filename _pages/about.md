 I am currently a Ph.D. Researcher at [Inria](http://inria.fr), where I have been working since October 2020 on my [thesis](https://www.theses.fr/s246965) titled: <i>A Framework for Sound and Expressive Runtime Verification of Multithreaded Applications</i> with my supervisor [Yli√®s Falcone](https://www.ylies.fr). My research falls under formal methods and software engineering, specifically [runtime verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification) of concurrent and distributed programs. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at the American University of Beirut (AUB) as a Senior Software Engineer and Analyst for nearly seven years. During this time, I developed various lighthouse projects, including the student's electronic voting system, a payments portal, and an online retail system. I also led a team of computer science and engineering students working on projects for the university. In the past, I held the position of Software Development Team Lead at HealthInvest. 

Throughout my career, I have earned several recognitions, such as the Microsoft Most Valued Professional MVP award for three consecutive years ([2014-2016](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000832)) and the AUB Computer Science Graduate Student of the Year award in  <a href="{{ page.pdf1 | prepend: 'assets/pdf/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >2019</a>. I have also authored the book Microsoft Azure Storage Essentials, published by Packt in [2015](https://www.packtpub.com/product/microsoft-azure-storage-essentials/9781784396237). As a dedicated computer scientist and software engineer, my commitment to keep learning and growing has been the driving force behind my contributions to the academic and professional communities. I strive to make a positive impact in my field and collaborate with others to achieve our shared goals.
