I am currently a research engineer and Ph.D. candidate at [INRIA](http://inria.fr) under the [CORSE](https://team.inria.fr/corse/) team, where I have been working since October 2019 under the supervision of [Yliès Falcone](https://www.ylies.fr). My research falls under software engineering and formal methods, where I specialize in program instrumentation and [runtime verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification) of concurrent and distributed programs. My efforts have led to numerous peer-reviewed papers and the developement of advanced tools in this field. As part of my doctoral research, I had the opportunity to visit the [Formal Computer Science Laboratory](https://liflab.ca) at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi ([UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca)) in 2021 and 2022 where I collaborated with [Sylvain Hallé](https://leduotang.ca/sylvain/).


Before shifting into research, I have a track record of 10 years in software development and project management building software across various sectors, including public services, healthcare, education, and commerce. Throughout my career, I have earned several recognitions, such as the [Microsoft Most Valued Professional MVP](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000832) award for three consecutive years (2014-2016) and the AUB Computer Science Graduate Student of the Year award in  <a href="{{ page.pdf1 | prepend: 'assets/pdf/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >2019</a>. I have also authored the book [Microsoft Azure Storage Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/product/microsoft-azure-storage-essentials/9781784396237), published by Packt in 2015.
