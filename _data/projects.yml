- title: CPS4EU Europe
  year: 2019-2022
  tags: Cyber-Physical Systems, WP 5 - Tools Background and Requirement Analysis
  role:  Reliability Research Specialist
  description: During my work on the CPS4EU project, we focused on enhancing the reliability of Cyber-Physical Systems. We established a single flow for both modeling and verification of component-based systems. One of the practical outcomes was devising preventive actions for drone flight collisions by monitoring specific scenarios.To streamline this process, we integrated DR-BIP (Dynamic Reconfigurable Modeling) with THEMIS (Decentralized Monitoring Framework), enabling automated monitoring and further analyzing Gazebo traces of drone simulations. Collaborations with UGA and TUC were instrumental in our project. Additionally, our work intersected with the "Collaborative Lifting" use case of Work Package 8, leading to improved design-time automation and the integration of new tools.

- title: EBML Lebanon
  year: 2018
  tags: Distributed Web Application
  role:  Chief Developer
  description: We designed and implemented a distributed web application that collects streams of water consumption data from smart meters. The application processes the data and handles billing while monitoring consumption to generate alerts and notifications. The result is a cutting-edge application deployed in parts of Beirut that when deployed across all of Lebanon has the potential to revolutionize the way water consumption is managed and monitored.
