Participated in the Runtime Verification conference ([RV'23](https://rv23.csd.auth.gr)) in Thessaloniki, Greece; where I presented a [tutorial](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44267-4_23) on the instrumentation of JVM-based programs and also presented a [DSL](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44267-4_17) for specifying instrumentation with BISM.
